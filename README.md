Retroarch Launcher for AKL

The Retroarch launcher depends on an Retroarch instance to be able to launch the scanned ROM files.

## Creating a Retroarch Launcher

When you create a Retroarch launcher AKL will try to find all Retroarch configuration files available
in the application folder. Either select one of the found configuration files or specify the path to
the configuration file manually. Once given AKL will automatically load the configuration file and
use the configured cores and infos folder to present the list of available cores.

When you select the desired core AKL will also apply the default ROM extensions of the core and use
the systemname and manufactorer as default information for the launcher. All of this you can change
in the following steps after selecting the core.

You can also add extra launch arguments, but take note that the default launching arguments will be
already added by the launcher itself. The used arguments are for selecting the correct core instance,
the correct configuration file and ofcourse the actual ROM file. 

Details about the CLI arguments can be found [here](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/cli-intro/).

## On Android

The default paths for Retroarch cores and info files under Android are only scannable when the OS
is rooted. When running on a non-rooted Android box the best option is to open up Retroarch and
configure paths for the cores and infos that are actually accessible. 
Don't forget to update/download the cores and info file after changing the paths.
